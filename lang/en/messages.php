    'about_description' => "Woman Painter Community (Wopanco) is a warm and colorful space for women who want to express themselves through painting. Here, the brush is not just a tool, but a bridge to share stories, heal, and channel limitless creativity.\n\nWopanco shelters women painters from various backgrounds with diverse abilities, from beginners to experts. We create art on canvas, wood, fabric, and other unique craft media. Every work is born from sensitivity, joy, and the spirit of self-empowerment.\n\nAt Wopanco, we encourage each other, share techniques, attend exciting workshops, and collaborate on joint art projects. The atmosphere is full of laughter, support, and a sense of family, a place where we can celebrate ourselves and our creativity freely.\n\nIn short, Woman Painter Community is a creative home for women who want to grow, create, and inspire each other through the world of painting.",
